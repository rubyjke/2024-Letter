        To my fellow Scarborugh surivor, <br>
        <br>
        Thank you so much for coming to Celestial (and helping blow up so many balloons)!! I'm so glad I got to meet you that day. <br>
        Our conversations have been some of the most insightful and meaningful conversations I've had this year and I appreciate all the wisdom you've shared throughout all of them. <br>
        You're one of the most caring people I know and somehow insanely knowledgeable about so much. Most importantly, you've helped me become more compassionate, even in difficult situations. <br>
        Thank you for encouraging me to come to the Toronto meetup and for being a great friend. <br>
