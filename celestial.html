        To my fellow Celestial oranizers, <br>
        <br>
        First and foremost, I am proud of all of you. It's crazy to think that Celestial was only a couple months ago and that we managed to pull it all off! <br>
        I had the time of my life during our dinner between the food (that I still think about to this day) and the mocktails to the friendships, connections, and shared wisdom that blossomed that night.<br>
        A huge thank you to all of you who labourosly helped blow up and tie all those balloons and to everyone for putting together such a memorable event including everthing from the workshops to the impromptu karaoke. <br>
        Lastly, a special shout out to Vivian and Emma for taking me on the team and to Vivian, Dasha, Luning, and Hannie for blindly trusting me to guide you through Toronto. <br>
        <br>
        Love you all and hope we get to reunite soon, <br>
        <br>
