        To the biggest blahaj enthusiast I know, <br>
        <br>
        Thank you for being the first person to DM me on Slack when I joined Hack Club, you've done an amazing job making the community feel so inclusive and friendly! <br>
        I'm so glad we met during Boreal, that you came to visit Celestial, and for our recent Toronto meetup! You really have a knack for organizing community events and you've been incredibly kind overall. <br>
        <br>
        Sincerely,<br>
        your djungleskog enthusiast
