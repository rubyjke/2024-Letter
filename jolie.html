        Jolie(ollierolliepollie),<br>
        <br>
        Words will never be able to fully express how grateful I am for you. <br>
        This year has been the wildest rollercoaster of my life and just like the ones at Wonderland, you've stuck by my side through it all.<br>
        From keeping me sane through the roughest patch of my life to celebrating with me during the greatest, I'm so glad I've had you with me.<br>
        Thank you for showering me with more love than I could ever deserve. <br>
        Thank you for inspiring me with your kindness, grit, and encouragement. <br>
        Thank you for the many packs of sour straps and stickers you've gifted me simply because you knew I needed something to brighten my day. <br>
        Thank you for listening to me, allowing me to be vulnerable with you, and for never judging me. <br>
        Thank you for listening to my endless rants about the cruelty of chemistry, octave-scales, and everything else.<br>
        Thank you for being the best best friend I could ever wish for. <br>
        <br>
        I'm both excited and terrified of what 2025 has in store for me, but I find comfort knowing that no matter what I face, I'll have you there to support me. <br>
        <br>
        Cheers (with strange soda mixes), <br>
        <br>
        The strange girl from Coscto you met twelve years ago.
