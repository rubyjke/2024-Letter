        To my fellow almost-lifeguard and Flair airlines survivor, <br>
        <br>
        From meeting each other on Boreal, to the counteless meetups since, and doing Space Apps together, our friendship has been crazy. <br>
        Thank you so much for lending me your charger that first day, always showing up despite your busy karate schedule, and for all the awesome film photos. <br> 
        It amazes me that you're still in Grade 11, yet already making some impossibly impressive strides in life. <br>
        Keep surviving iB, I'm so proud and excited to see what's ahead for you!<br>
        <br>
        Awaiting the Yukon Striker, <br>
