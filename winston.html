        To the biggest Nandos lover known to man,<br>
        <br>
        Thank you for welcoming me to your dinner and breakfast table during Boreal (the gum incident lives rent free in my mind) and for coming to hang out in Toronto!<br>
        Your achievements amaze me and your passion for music is so inspiring. I would probably hate piano significantly more if not for you.<br>
        I really loved hearing about all your Spotify playlists and appreaciate all the music recommendations you've given (including FE!N).<br>
        <br>
        Waiting for the day I get to try Raising Cane's,<br>
