        To my dearest drug dealer,<br>
        <br>
        I am so grateful we met that fateful first day of Boreal!<br>
        Thank you for being our designated Vancouver tour guide that day and for offering me Tylenol when I felt like I was dying on that train (that for the record did not work).<br>
        You've been one of the most supportive friends during the train wreck of the past couple months and you hype up my art unlike anyone else. <br>
        I'm so glad you came to Hack the North and I'm sorry I didn't get to return the Tylonol favor (although I literally had plans A though E to getting you Tylenol smh).<br>
        You inspire me like crazy with your mindset and determination to lock in every single day and how eloquent your writing always is. <br>
        <br>
        The Chinese Gardens await me,<br>
        <br>
        The biggest ochem hater known to man <br>
        <br>
        p.s. thank you for all the Skytrain photos, they remind me Boreal each and every single time.<br>
