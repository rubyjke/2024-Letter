            Boreal was the genuine highlight and turning point of my year. <br>
            Even though I missed some parts (curse those migranes), it was and still is the greatest expereince of my life. <br>
            <br>
            To the organizers, <br>
            Thank you all for putting together such an unforgettable expereince. <br>
            Even though it didn't go to plan, Boreal was incredibly special and you all did an amazing job adapting when things veered off course. <br>
            Special thanks to Zoya for onboarding me and for making some fire mocktails, to Alex for helping me get Tailscale set up (even though I had and still have no idea what it is), and to Robert for working so hard booking everyone's flights. <br>
            <br>
            To everyone I met, <br>
            Thank you all for inspiring me so much. I wouldn't be where I am today or be a fraction of who I am without meeting you all.<br>
            <br>
            Hoping we all get to reunite again someday, <br>
            <br>
