        To my favourite honourary Canadian, <br>
        <br>
        I'm so happy we met during Boreal and impossibly thankful that you made the trip to come visit Toronto afterwards.<br>
        From Gong Cha to countless Facetimes, our friendship has been so much fun!!<br>
        You take amazing photos, are cracked beyond belief, and have one heck of a memory for someone who's as sleep depreived as I am. <br>
        Thank you for being the glue in our friend group and always being down to yap. <br>
        <br>
        Visit again soon, <br>
        <br>
