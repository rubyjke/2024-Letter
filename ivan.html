        To the craziest jack of all trades and future neurologist, <br>
        <br>
        It was awesome meeting you during Boreal and although you've been sick/busy for the past few other meetups, I'm really glad we got to reunite at Hack the North!<br>
        It genuinely amazes me how insanely cracked you are at so many things from chess to ballroom dancing, I genuinely aspire to be een a fraction as much of a polymath as you are someday. <br>
